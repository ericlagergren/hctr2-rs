# hctr2

[![Docs][docs-img]][docs-link]

Length-preserving encryption algorithm https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1441.pdf

## Installation

```bash
[dependencies]
hctr2 = "0.2"
```

## Performance

The performance of HCTR2 is primarily determined by the XCTR and
POLYVAL implementations. This module provides ARMv8 and x86-64 
assembly XCTR implementations and uses a hardware-accelerated
POLYVAL implementation (see [polyval](https://docs.rs/polyval)).
